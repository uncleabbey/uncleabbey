### Uncleabbey

I am a javascript developer who is also in love with python. Currently, I code mostly in vanilla js, React for frontend. I have also found a niche with writing backend with Node or Django rest framework.

I'm Looking to collaborate on [django-react-starter](https://github.com/uncleabbey/django-react-starter). A starter pack for developers that wants to use react as frontend for their django application.

I also hope with time, i will start to write articles on things that gave me problem in project so as for others to avoid the same pitfall. By things in the last statement, I mean bugs, Nasty bugs that we all love to hate  ðŸ˜„.

I am also looking for work as a junior developer, i am ready to learn on the job and build amazing stuff
